# I've made a suggestion. Now what?
Let us know if you have a Work In Progress suggestion by adding [WIP] to the front of the suggestion name. This will let our team know that the suggestion isn't ready for review. Be sure to update the first post with any decisions and discussion from the comments so our review team sees them.

Once your suggestion is ready for review, let us know in a comment and we'll flag it for our review team. Our review team will meet to discuss the changes and we will decide how to proceed. Meetings will take place in the Discord in a public channel where anyone interested may sit in on the meetings. Minutes from previous meetings will be available in this repository.
